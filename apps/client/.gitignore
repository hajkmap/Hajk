# See https://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.

# * ABOUT SKIPPED FILES * 
# Some files in the repository are checked in, but further revisions to them are ignored.
# This is achived with --skip-worktree, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/39776107/709339.
#
# To ADD FILES TO BE SKIPPED:
# $Â git update-index --skip-worktree someFile.txt
# To LIST FILES THAT ARE ON SKIP LIST:
# $ git ls-files -v . | grep ^S
# To REMOVE FILES FROM SKIP LIST:
# git update-index --no-skip-worktree someFile.txt
