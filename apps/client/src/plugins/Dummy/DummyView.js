// Hajk components are primarily styled in two ways:
// - Using the styled-utility, see: https://mui.com/system/styled/
// - Using the sx-prop, see: https://mui.com/system/basics/#the-sx-prop
// The styled-utility creates a reusable component, and might be the
// best choice if the style is to be applied in several places.

// The styled components should be created at the top of the document
// (but after imports) for consistency. Hajk does not have a naming
// convention for the styled components, but keep in mind to use names
// that does not collide with regular components. (E.g. a styled div
// should not be called Box).

// The example below shows how a <Button /> with a bottom margin can be created.
// Notice that we are also accessing the application theme.
const ButtonWithBottomMargin = styled(Button)(({ theme }) => ({
  marginBottom: theme.spacing(2),
}));

// We can also create a custom button that accepts border as a
// prop. If the border prop is missing, we fall back on the theme
// divider color. (borderColor would be a more fitting name, but
// since this is a custom prop it must be all lowerCase, hence border will have
// to do!)
const ButtonWithBorder = styled(Button)(({ border, theme }) => ({
  border: `${theme.spacing(0.5)} solid ${border ?? theme.palette.divider}`,
}));

// All MUI components (and all styled components, even styled div:s!) will have access to the sx-prop.
// Check out how the sx-prop works further down.

function DummyView(props) {
  // We're gonna need to access the snackbar methods. Let's use the provided hook.
  const { closeSnackbar, enqueueSnackbar } = useSnackbar();

  // We're gonna need to use the event observers. Let's destruct them so that we can
  // get a hold of them easily. The observers can be accessed directly via the props:
  const { globalObserver, localObserver } = props;

  // We're gonna need to keep track of if we're allowed to save stuff in LS. Let's use the hook.
  const { functionalCookiesOk } = useCookieStatus(globalObserver);

  // We're gonna want to keep track of some state. Let's use the useState hook.
  // If you want to read up on how state is managed in functional components, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [borderColor, setBorderColor] = useState("#FFFFFF");

  // You don’t have to use many state variables. State variables can hold objects and arrays just fine,
  // so you can still group related data together. However, unlike this.setState in a class, updating a
  // state variable always replaces it instead of merging it. A grouped state, with two variables,
  // could look something like this:
  // const [someState, setSomeState] = useState({
  //   counter: 0,
  //   borderColor: "#FFFFFF",
  // });
  // So how would you go about updating just one of the variables in the grouped state?
  // Well, all you have to do is to make sure to merge the old state manually.
  // For example, to increment the counter, but keep the border-color constant, we can do:
  // setSomeState((state) => ({...state, counter: state.counter + 1}))

  // We've already covered the useState hook. Let's look into another one. The useCallback hook
  // returns a memoized callback (cached, only computed again when the inputs in the dependency
  // array changes). Why do we want to memoize this function? It only returns some JSX? Well,
  // since we want to use this function in a useEffect hook (more on that later) we want to make
  // sure that this function does not change on every render. (If it would, the useEffect would run
  // on every render, which we want to avoid).
  const renderDrawerContent = useCallback(() => {
    return (
      // The sx-prop gives us some shorthand commands, for example, the paddings below
      // will be set to theme.spacing(2), and not 2px! Make sure to read up on how the sx-prop
      // works before using it, check out the MUI docs.
      <Box sx={{ paddingLeft: 2, paddingRight: 2 }}>
        <Typography variant="h6">Dummy</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1">
          Dummy har anropat globalObserver och bett om att få lägga till en
          knapp uppe i headern. När du trycker på knappen visas det här
          innehållet i sidopanelen.
        </Typography>
      </Box>
    );
  }, []); // <-- dependency array. (Here we can add inputs that would cause the callback to be re-calculated).

  // Another hook that is used a lot in functional components is the useEffect hook.
  // Mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not allowed inside the main body
  // of a function component (referred to as React’s render phase). Doing so will lead to confusing bugs
  // and inconsistencies in the UI. Instead, use the useEffect hook. The function passed to useEffect will run after
  // the render is committed to the screen. For more information, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect

  // When moving from Class-based components to Functional components I've seen several developers trying to mimic the
  // constructor (which is obviously only present in Class-based components) by using the useEffect hook. The useEffect hook
  // *could* be used in a "constructor like" fashion (by leaving the dependency array empty, making the effect only run once).
  // But be aware! The effect runs AFTER the initial render, in contrast to the 'real' constructor which runs before the initial
  // render. To get around this, I would suggest to create a custom hook instead. (To be fair, constructor-like behavior is rarely
  // needed in functional components. But sometimes it **is** needed, and I thought that some clarification regarding how to work
  // around this could be valid).

  // Well, here we use a useEffect to publish a message on the global observer (after the initial render).
  // The message sent is used to render whatever 'renderDrawerContent' returns in Hajks drawer.
  useEffect(() => {
    globalObserver.publish("core.addDrawerToggleButton", {
      value: "dummy",
      ButtonIcon: BugReportIcon,
      caption: "Dummyverktyg",
      drawerTitle: "Dummyverktyg",
      order: 100,
      renderDrawerContent: renderDrawerContent,
    });
  }, [globalObserver, renderDrawerContent]); // <-- The dependency array. Since we reference the global observer and 'renderDrawerContent' we have to include these.
  // There is a lot more to say regarding the useEffect hook, but I'll leave that to you to read up on. Just a couple of tips:
  // - Remember the cleanup-function! Especially when you're working with subscriptions.
  // - Remember that you can use several useEffect hooks! Maybe you want to do something when 'counter' changes?

  const buttonClick = () => {
    // Here's an example of how to access the plugin's model:
    console.log("Dummy can access model's map:", props.model.getMap());

    // We have access to plugin's observer too. Below we publish an event that the parent
    // component is listing to, see Dummy.js for how to subscribe to events.
    localObserver.publish(
      "dummyEvent",
      "This has been sent from DummyView using the Observer"
