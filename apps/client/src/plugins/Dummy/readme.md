## The Dummy-plugin

To make it easier for developers to create new plugins in Hajk we've decided to provide a Dummy-plugin. The Dummy-plugin contains information and examples regarding plugin development. If you find that something that is regularly used is missing, feel free to add it!

### Creating a new plugin

When creating a new plugin, there are some crucial steps to get going:

- Make a copy of the plugin-template (The plugin template is still TODO, so copy the Dummy for now)
- Set proper names on files and components
- **Make sure to add the new plugin to buildConfig.json (both to "allTools" as well as "activeTools")**
- Make sure to add the Dummy-plugin to the tool-array in the mapConfig.
