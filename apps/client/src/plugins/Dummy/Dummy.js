  // We're gonna want to keep track of some state... Let's use the State hook.
  // If you want to read up on how state is managed in functional components, see: https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html
  // There is a more thorough explanation regarding state in ./DummyView.js
  // Here is an example where we keep track of a state object (kind of like class-based components).
  const [state, setState] = React.useState({ title: "Dummy", color: null });
  // But we can also keep just one variable, allowing us to keep naming etc. clean. The pluginShown state
  // keeps track of wether the plugin is shown or not, and is obviously initiated to the visibleAtStart-option set in admin.
  const [pluginShown, setPluginShown] = React.useState(
    props.options.visibleAtStart ?? false
  );
  // Another state variable we need to keep track off is the current draw-interaction. (Used to tell the drawModel
  // what we want to draw). Since this is an example, we'll keep it simple: It will either be set to "Polygon" or "" (off).
  const [drawInteraction, setDrawInteraction] = React.useState("");
  // We're gonna want to initiate an observer which can be used for communication within the component.
  // We must remember that in functional components all code within the component runs on every render.
  // This means that if we would initiate the observer as follow:
  // [Don't do  this!] const localObserver = Observer(); we would create a new observer on every render... Not good.
  //
  // So how would we combat this? One way would be to use the useRef-hook, as follows:
  // const localObserver = React.useRef(Observer());
  // The useRef hook memoizes the value and does not create a new reference on every render. The drawback
  // of this approach is that in order to access the variable we have to do as follows:
  // const observer = localObserver.current;
  //
  // There is some debate regarding my next statement, but my idea is that the useState hook would be
  // a better fit in this case... Why? Well, we combat the issue with re-assignments on every render (since
  // the useState hook also persists the value) and we do not have to use ".current" property to access the value.
  //
  // Some criticism regarding this approach might be related to rendering issues if we for some reason happen
  // to update the state (which would be cumbersome since we're not exposing the updater) or that we're using
  // an anti-pattern since we're not using the state as intended. I don't agree, especially since the useRef hook
  // is basically the useState hook with some synthetic sugar (useRef is basically useState({current: initialValue})[0]).
  //
  // I hope that the explanation will help you. Anyways, let's initiate the local observer in the following, recommended fashion:
  const [localObserver] = React.useState(Observer());
  // We're also gonna initiate the plugin-model (which should/could hold the plugin's logic, to avoid bloating the components).
  const [dummyModel] = React.useState(

        localObserver: localObserver,
        app: props.app,
        map: props.map,
      })
  );
  // There are some core models that can be used as well. The core models take care of logic that is used in several places in the application.
  // Some example core models are: SearchModel (for searching in WFS etc.), DrawModel (for drawing on the map), KmlModel (for importing/exporting .kml).
  // Let's initiate the DrawModel!
  const [drawModel] = React.useState(
    () =>

        layerName: "pluginDummy",

  // Subscriptions to events etc. should be done in the useEffect hooks. Pay attention to the
  // return (cleanup) function which makes sure to unsubscribe from the event when the component unmounts.
