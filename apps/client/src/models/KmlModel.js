/*
 * A model supplying useful KML-functionality.
 * Required settings:
 * - layerName: (string): The name of the layer that should be connected to the KML-model.
 *   If it already exists a layer in the map with the same name, the model will be connected
 *   to that layer. Otherwise, a new vector-layer will be created and added to the map.
 * - map: (olMap): The current map-object.
 * Optional settings:
 * - enableDragAndDrop: (boolean): If true, drag-and-drop of .kml-files will be active.
 * - drawModel (DrawModel): If supplied, imported features will be drawn using the draw-model.
 *
 * Exposes a couple of methods:
 * - parseFeatures(kmlString, settings): Accepts a KML-string and tries to parse it to OL-features.
 * - import(kmlString, settings): Accepts a KML-string and adds the KML-features to the layer.
 * - export(): Exports all features in the current kml-layer.
 * - removeImportedFeatures(): Removes all imported features from the kml-source.
 * - zoomToCurrentExtent(): Zooms the map to the current extent of the kml-source.
 * - setLayer(layerName): Accepts a string containing a layer name. Will set current layer.
 * - getCurrentLayerName(): Returns the name of the vectorLayer that is currently connected to the model.
 * - getCurrentExtent(): Returns the current extent of the kml-source.
