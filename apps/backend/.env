# *** README FIRST ***
# This file contains environmental variables that will be passed to the Hajk backend.
# All variable that are set here can be overridden by setting them on runtime before
# initiating the script.
#
# This file is organized into categories. Each category starts with a header, surrounded by "***".

# *** General NodeJS settings ***

# This is useful in a cluster environment where we want the different cluster
# instances to write to different log files. 
# Suppose a scenario where you want to share the codebase among servers (so you only
# need to update files in one place). This .env file would be shared too, naturally, as
# you probably want the same settings (mostly). There are however cases where you'd like
# to have unique env variables on the different cluster instances, and one such variable is
# the HAJK_INSTANCE_ID below.
#
# The value below will be applied to the log's name. Note that you should override it on a per-instance-basis
# because this .env file is probably shared by multiple instances. Refer to your OS's documentation
# for how to set environment variables on runtime, e.g. on *NIX systems it's: 'MY_VARIABLE=foo node index.js'
HAJK_INSTANCE_ID=

# Set to "development" or "production", see: https://expressjs.com/en/advanced/best-practice-performance.html#set-node_env-to-production
NODE_ENV=development

# *** HTTP SERVER SETTINGS ***
# Port that the HTTP server will listen on
PORT=3002

# *** Backend API versions ***
# Hajk's backend comes with a versioned API. 
# The initial, .NET compatible API is version 1.
# The improved version, which includes e.g. consolidated loading of 
# config in client is version 2. 
#
# The recommended setting is to leave this empty (i.e. outcommented). This means that all
# currently supported versions of the API are enabled.
# If you want to enable only specific version(s), supply a comma-separated list, e.g.
#API_VERSIONS=2,3 # Disables /api/v1, enables /api/v2 and /api/v3

# When an Express app is running behind a proxy, app.set('trust proxy') should be
# set. This setting simply passes its value to Express as the value of 'trust proxy'. 
# To sum up: if set to true, the client IP will be extracted from the leftmost portion
# of X-Forwarded-For. Else, the client's IP is assumed to be the same as req.connection.remoteAddress. 
# See https://expressjs.com/en/guide/behind-proxies.html for an explanation. 
EXPRESS_TRUST_PROXY=

# Should the experimental WebSockets API be enabled?
ENABLE_WEBSOCKETS=false

# Limit the body size of incoming requests. The default value, 1000kb, is rather
# high, in order to accommodate for requests from admin that can contain entire
# DocumentHandler configuration, when that plugin is activated. 
REQUEST_LIMIT=1000kb

# Usually it's a good idea to make compress the http server's output. There are
# however situations, such as high-traffic sites, where the GZIP compression is
# best implemented at the reverse proxy level, which makes it unnecessary to enable
# it in Express. This option makes it possible to disable Hajk backend's built-in 
# compression.
#ENABLE_GZIP_COMPRESSION=true

# Control which directories will be statically exposed on the HTTP server.
# Because the endpoints of the Static Exposer are not versioned, we must
# decide which API version we want to use for those routes. The default value
# is "LATEST" but you can specify any of the allowed API versions. Usually, 
# the default value is fine.
STATIC_EXPOSER_VERSION=LATEST 
# Expose Hajk's client app directly under /
EXPOSE_CLIENT=true
# If we expose /admin, we want probably to restrict access to it. Make sure 
# to enable AD_* settings below in order for this to work.
RESTRICT_ADMIN_ACCESS_TO_AD_GROUPS=

# Other static files can be shared (and restricted to AD groups!) via Hajk's backend. 
# E.g. to make foo-bar accessible as /foo-bar for groups gr1 and gr2, put the "foo-bar" 
# directory inside "static" and add "EXPOSE_AND_RESTRICT_STATIC_FOO_BAR=gr1,gr2" to this file. 

# If no restriction is specified but the key exists, the access is unrestricted.
EXPOSE_AND_RESTRICT_STATIC_API_EXPLORER=
# If key exists and is specified, the access is limited to the specified groups
EXPOSE_AND_RESTRICT_STATIC_ADMIN=GIS_ADMIN
