 * @description Proposed setup:

 * Request -> Proxy
 *                  \-> GeoServer
 *
 * 1. User's request goes to a Proxy. That proxy is the only component visible to the outside world.
 *    Neither MapService nor GeoServer are reachable directly by Request.
 * 2. Proxy authenticates the user. If authentication is successful, Proxy will add user's userPrincipalName
 *    value as the value of the "X-Control-Header" request header. The header's name is can be
 *    overridden in .env.
 * 3. MapService (i.e. this application) should be configured in such a way that it only allows
 *    requests from specified IPs (which should be the Proxy IP).
 *    Alternatively, it could allow
 *    requests from anywhere, but only respect the value of X-Control-Header if request comes
 *    from a specified IP.
