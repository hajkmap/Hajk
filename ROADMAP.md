# ROADMAP

_Last updated: 2024-11-13_

The following is a high-level overview of the planned development for Hajk and its various components (Backend, Client UI, Admin UI).

## 3.14

_Update: 3.14 has been released on Sep 16th. See [release notes](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/releases/tag/v3.14.0)._

The final release to include both .NET and NodeJS backends as official solutions.

Also, this will be the last release in the 3.x branch.

## 4.0

This release marks the removal of the .NET backend, leaving NodeJS as the sole official backend solution.

In addition, Client UI sees significant updates to the Layer Switcher tool as well as the application's window management.

## 5.0

The Hajk 5 branch introduces several additions and changes:

- A completely rewritten Admin UI (development begins in fall 2024).
- The backend will no longer support the legacy file-based JSON store. Instead, all configuration will be stored in a relational database (most likely PostgreSQL, though other solutions may be supported in the future).
