# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### BREAKING

- This release marks the removal of the legacy V1 API (`/api/v1`) in both the NodeJS backend and the old .NET 4.5 backend (refer to the _Removed_ section below). Client UI is now V2-compatible only, as it requires the consolidated loading method. This means that you need to review and update your configuration, both regarding Client and Admin. Please refer to `docs/migrate-to-v2-api.md` for details.
- This release marks deprecation of some plugins that either became replaced by a new solution or transformed into a community plugin. Refer to `docs/deprecated-plugins.md` for details.
- Although not exactly a _breaking_ change, but it fits well here: **the repo has been restructured**. All apps can now be found in the `apps/` directory. The `new-` prefix has been removed from apps' names. Some shell scripts now live in `scripts/` while the majority of Docker-related files, except for the official Dockerfile, have been moved into the `Docker/` directory.

## [3.13.24] - 2024-01-17

### Added

- LayerSwitcher: It is now possible to auto-rotate the Map to a admin-specified value. Useful for layers with photos taken in different directions. [#1451](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1451)

## [3.13.23] - 2024-01-17

_A quick follow-up to 3.13.22, that had some issues with certain map configurations._

### Fixed

- Backend: Solved an issue that could stop certain maps from loading if a tool's option's property value was `null`. Introduced in [#1438](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1438), fixed in [77503ee](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/77503ee617b1579970cb2ea95c7b95143d024df0).

### Added

- FeatureInfo: New filters. [#1443](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1443)

### Changed

- Backend: show 403 Forbidden rather than 500 if access was not allowed. [98b9280](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/98b9280b56a05eaa2a037359341329ed5fc46f8e)

### Added

- DocumentHandler - possible to save documents inside subfolders. [#1402](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/pull/1402)
- Backend: Another method of gaining AD groups has been added. It's possible to circumvent the current solution (where Backend talks to the LDAP server) if one's setup allows for getting the AD groups elsewhere (i.e. from a proxy if setup on IIS). [#1439](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1439)
- Backend: Respect nested `visibleForGroups` within tool options. [#1438](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1438)
- Backend: show 403 Forbidden rather than 500 if access was not allowed. [90b1725](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/90b172595c16078053c2d03130971e89091511aa)

### Fixed

- Client core: Fix layout issue with hidden DrawerToggleButtons [#1436](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/pull/1436)
- PropertyChecker: Better sorting and layer loading failed indicator in layers list. [8df1b92](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/8df1b9253aae06c8b42a37b36100a595e4e7c74b)
- PropertyChecker: Don't allow clicking on points that'd result in response from multiple properties. User is informed when such a click occurs and told to click further away from the property border.
- Bookmark: Fixed removal issue. [0f1172f](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/0f1172f108d57575dbe8e8ecabb20aa8b8a15c4e)
- Print: Print tool does not print WMS layers that requires credentials[#1442](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1442)

## [3.13.21] - 2023-11-17

### Fixed

- The tools list in Admin is now refreshed: only current tools are available, sorting is alphabetical.

## [3.13.20] - 2023-11-14

### Added

- Support for the EPSG:5847 in Admin UI. Keep in mind that you still need to add appropriate projection definitions to each map config.
- It is now possible to disable unused tabs in LayerSwitcher, e.g. only show the Background layers tab. [#1431](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1431)

## [3.13.19] - 2023-10-29

### Added

- Client: LayerSwitcher now indicates which groups have enabled layers by styling those groups with a bold font. [#1257](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1257)

## [3.13.18] - 2023-10-27

### Added

- Client/Admin: it's now possible to configure the Search tool so that it starts with the search field in focus. [#1424](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1424)

### Fixed

- Client: avoid long floating values for the `z` parameter in URL hash. [#1422](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1422)

## [3.13.17] - 2023-10-25

### Security

- Backend: Tightened security: if AD_LOOKUP_ACTIVE is 'false' but RESTRICT_ADMIN_ACCESS_TO_AD_GROUPS has a value, access to admin-only endpoints will be restricted (to everyone).

## [3.13.16] - 2023-10-25

### Added

- Backend: More logging options in `.env`. Also, we now save 14 old log files by default (was 1 before). [#1421](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1421)

### Fixed

- Client: Drawer Toggle Button could sometimes disappear in certain map configurations. Fixed in #1414. [#1414](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1414)

## [3.13.15] - 2023-10-24

### Added

- Backend: added `/fir` endpoints. This functionality requires the _myCarta FR Direkt_ service. [#1416](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1416)

## [3.13.14] - 2023-10-06

### Fixed

- The `/ad/findCommonADGroupsForUsers` endpoint works again. [#1415](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1415)

## [3.13.13] - 2023-10-05

- Added a confirmation dialog that shows on window close. It informs the user about unsaved changes (in e.g. Measurer or Sketch) that will be lost. [#1403](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1403)

### Fixed

- Support for relative URLs [#1399](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1399)

### Security

- Upgraded Backend dependencies.

## [3.13.11] - 2023-09-05

### Added

- Client UI: It is now possible for admins to make the side drawer permanent (i.e. not hidable by user). [#1316](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1316), [#1367](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1367).

## [3.13.10] - 2023-09-05

### Added

- Measurer plugin: It is now possible to perform perpendicular measurements by using a modifier key (Ctrl or Cmd, depending on the OS) [#1361](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1361)
- The HTML `target` attribute is now accepted and rendered correctly if specified, [#1389](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/pull/1389)
- Added the possibility to change icon background in feature list, [#1385](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1385)

## [3.13.9] - 2023-08-22

### Fixed

- Bug fix for the Simple Edit Workflow added in 3.13.8

## [3.13.8] - 2023-08-21

### Changed

- Swagger UI API Explorer now defaults to the V2 path

## [3.13.7] - 2023-08-18

### Changed

- Layout fixes to the Error page added in 3.13.6
- Made some `appConfig.json` keys optional by not expecting any values for them in `index.js`

## [3.13.6] - 2023-08-17

### Added

- A new error page is displayed if Hajk fails on the initial load. The new page also shows a _Reset_ button, which may fix common loading errors by cleaning up the client's state. [Commit](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/f2201fc2c63988175172315313344a8992a17c4d)

### Changed

- The consolidated loading approach, first added in [#682](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/682) is now the only way of loading Client UI. This fact allows for a lot of cleanups in the start-up code.

### Removed

- BREAKING: Client UI does not support V1 API anymore. The only supported way of loading the application is the new approach, introduced in #682.
- Since the change above, there is no more use for `experimentalNewApi` in `appConfig.json`. It has now been removed.

### Security

- A number of Client's dependencies have been upgraded.

## [3.13.5] - 2023-08-14

### Changed

- Fix to list sorting when toggling layers in a group layer ([#1362](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/issues/1362))
- Added missing dependencies in Client's [package.json](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/eadc703d9d90b9a3f793b6be422544251ec9a3f6)
- Imports are now made using relative paths. [Commit](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/413d40a081bfe1b1f9f3d436f07b918219375aa5)

### Removed

- Removed all references to the unused `shortcodes` feature in `FeatureInfo`. Also, removed unused dependencies from Client's package.json. [Commit](https://github.com/hajkmap/Hajk/commit/436afad8d9dd37caec8cb4fe9dabeb4c03b67ff7)
- Legacy plugins removed in this release are:
  - `Draw` (use `Sketch` instead)
  - `Measure` (use `Measurer` instead)
- Also `VTSearch` was removed as it is to be transformed into a _community plugin_ (i.e. not included in the main build)

## [3.13.4] - 2023-08-14

### Fixed

- Restored the missing `.material-icons` class in our CSS. This disappeared in a recent MUI bump and has now to be added manually for font icons.
